## Elle ðŸ’™ - Mental Health Companion & Knowledge Base

### Project Overview
Elle is a multi-modal mental health AI assistant built using **LangChains agentic workflow**, while also providing a knowledge base for document-based question answering. Built for the **Sarvam AI Litmus Test (ML Focus)**, Elle demonstrates advanced LLM integration techniques with a focus on **context management, multi-modal interactions, and specialized domain adaptation**.

## Key ML/AI Features

### 1. Dynamic Therapeutic Approach Selection
Elle implements an advanced context-aware system that intelligently selects different therapeutic approaches based on user input:

- **Specialized Therapy Selection:** Routes to one of six agents each with specialised prompts as in ```prompts.yaml```:
  - General Emotional Support (empathetic listening)
  - Suicide Prevention (crisis intervention)
  - Anger Management (emotion regulation)
  - Motivational Support (for depression)
  - Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)
  - Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)

### 2. Key-Features
Elle enhances therapeutic interactions using multiple modalities:

- **Text:** Primary communication through text-based chat.
- **Image Generation:** Contextually relevant imagery generated based on therapeutic context.
- **Speech Recognition:** Voice input support for accessibility.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Audio output of responses when enabled.
- **Memory:** Uses memory for personalised responses which cater to the user's need.
- **Memory Summarisation:** Summarises and store the whole memory so as to make the system *scalable* and *robust*.
- **Privacy:** The summary of responses is stored using a unique ID so as to ensure privacy.
- **Multi-lingual:** Can generate respones in Several Languages.

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
The Knowledge Base component demonstrates advanced **RAG techniques**:

- **Document Processing:** PDF text extraction with recursive chunking.
- **Embedding Generation:** Semantic representation using Gemini Embedding model.
- **Similarity Search:** Vector-based retrieval using cosine similarity.
- **Context-Enhanced Generation:** Combines retrieved chunks with user queries for accurate answers.

### ML Models Used
- **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** Main conversation model for therapeutic responses.
- **Gemini 1.5 Flash:** Knowledge base query processing for faster document Q&A.
- **Gemini Embedding Model:** Document and query embedding for semantic search.
- **Google Speech Recognition:** Converting speech to text.

## Evaluation and Performance Optimization

- **Therapy Type Tracking:** Monitoring which therapeutic approaches are used most frequently.
- **Session Summary Analysis:** Automatic generation of session insights.
- **Error Handling:** Robust exception handling throughout the pipeline.
- **Caching Strategy:** Embeddings cached in session state for repeated queries.

---

### Scalability Considerations
Elleâ€™s architecture supports scaling through:

- **Stateless Design:** Core processing is stateless and can be horizontally scaled.
- **Separate Concerns:** UI, embedding generation, and LLM inference can scale independently.
- **Vector Database Integration:** Ready for integration with production vector databases.
- **Session Management:** UUID-based user tracking supports distributed sessions.

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Model Distillation:** Creating specialized smaller models for each therapy type.
- **Response Quality Metrics:** Implementing feedback loops for response quality.
- **Streaming Responses:** Adding incremental response rendering.
- **Advanced RAG:** Implementing hybrid search with metadata filtering.
- **Custom Fine-tuning:** Developing specialized models for mental health support.

## ML Research Innovations

- **Contextual Therapy Routing:** Automatic selection of therapeutic approach based on semantic content.
- **Multi-Modal Therapeutic Experience:** Combining text, speech, and images for holistic support.
- **Memory Summarization:** Using LLMs to distill conversation into meaningful context.
- **Domain-Specific RAG:** Knowledge base tailored for mental health resources.
